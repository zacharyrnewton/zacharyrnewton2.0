  <h4>The Beginning</h4>
  <p>To begin working on building the Safestep Floors brand, we first looked towards the competition to see what they were offering different from what Safestep Floors is offering. Upon reviewing these competitors, we were able to come up with a game plan and an approach to reaching the customer. The website is not the place to win people over, but simply be a place of reference, and a place to solidify the brand. The website needs to be simple and give the numbers that the COF of a potential client's floor should be.</p>

  <h4>The Logo</h4>
  <p>You can't have a successful brand without having a logo for your company to be identified by. The logo for Safestep Floors was discussed multiple times and multiple iterations were created before finally designing the logo that would represent the company. Both the client and the designer were satisfied. The logo shows the ability for a person to walk safely on a floor, just like the result of the service the company provides.</p>

  <h4>The Approach</h4>
  <p>The approach for the company regarding gaining clients is much more personal e.g. phone calls or face to face meetings. To aid Safestep Floors in these meetings, a brochure and business card is needed. This print work needs to represent the brand and provide customers with all of the essential information they need on the service, product, and outcome.</p>

  <h4>The Result</h4>
  <p>A solid brand with a client editable website using <a href="https://squarespace.com" target="_blank">Squarespace</a> to keep maintenance costs, hosting costs, and site-wide update costs low.
